    "title": "Life, the Universe, and Sum of Cubes: Finally an Answer for 42",
    "body": "In 1954, mathematicians from the University of Cambridge proposed a challenge to prove whether or not there are integers x, y, and z that satisfy the equation $x^3+y^3+z^3=n$ for each positive integer n. This type of equation, where all the variables must take integer values, is known as a Diophantine equation. Although this conjecture is easy to understand, the mathematical community has yet to give a complete answer. But mathematicians are one step closer to an answer with the discovery of a solution for $x^3+y^3+z^3=42 $by Andrew Booker and Andrew Sutherland: $(-80538738812075974)^3 + 80435758145817515^3 + 12602123297335631^3 = 42$. The values for x, y, and z appear to be obscure, random numbers taken from thin air, but they are the result of 1. 3 million hours of computing on a global grid of computers.       For one set of numbers, it is relatively simple to show that no solutions exist, and that is when the number n has a remainder of 4 or 5 when divided by 9. This is because all cubes either have a difference of 1, -1, or 0 with the closest multiple of 9, so the sum of three cubes will have a difference between 3 and -3 with the closest multiple of 9. The small cases of n = 1, 2, and 3 were quickly solved, and the solutions of these cases could be used to find solutions for any n that was 1, 2, or 3 times a perfect cube. Around the 1910’s, mathematicians were able to construct solutions for slightly larger numbers using the solutions to n = 1, 2, 3; however, after these families of solutions were found, they were stumped –– humans simply didn’t have the computing power to solve larger cases. No major breakthroughs were made until 2009, when Andreas-Stephan Elsenhans and Jörg Janhel created an algorithm, based on the theories of Noam Elkies, that could search for all solutions with n less than 1000 and max (   x   ,   y   ,   z   ) (the largest value amongst the absolute values of x, y and z) less than 10^14. With this algorithm, solutions were discovered for all n&lt;100 that did not have a remainder of 4 or 5 when divided by 9 - except for 33, 42, and 74, three values that continued to elude mathematicians.          The solution for 74 was discovered by Sander Huisman in 2016, who extended the algorithm used by Elsenhans and Janhel to max (   x   ,   y   ,   z   ) less than 10^15, but 33 and 42 remained unsolved, and many mathematicians theorized that there were no solutions for either number. Then, in February of 2019, University of Bristol mathematician Andrew Booker stumbled upon a YouTube video posted by Numberphile, a channel sponsored by the Mathematical Science Research Institute of Berkeley, California, that discussed the uncracked problem of 33. Booker decided to try his hand at solving the problem, and created an algorithm that relied on the minimum of   x   ,   y   , and   z   instead of the maximum. In just three weeks, he found an answer: 33 = 8,866,128,975,287,528^3 +(−8,778,405,442,862,239)^3 +(−2,736,111,468,807,040)^3. Now, the only unsolved number under 100 was 42. Booker enlisted the help of MIT mathematician Andrew Sutherland. He soon realized that solving 42 would be more difficult and would require more computing power than a single computer, so he turned to Charity Engine, a program that links home computers with other computers across the globe to use their spare computing power. After 1. 3 million hours of computing, Booker and Sutherland finally found the solution for 42. The only unsolved cases under 1000 that remain are 114, 165, 390, 579, 627, 633, 732, 906, 921, and 975, for which Booker and Sutherland are working on expanding their algorithm.    Up until now, the decidability of the sum of three cubes problem remains unknown: Mathematicians still cannot prove whether or not there is an algorithm that can, within a finite amount of time, return a solution for any value n. This problem relates to the tenth problem of Hilbert’s 23 problems, which were proposed by David Hilbert in 1900 as a list of the most challenging and influential unsolved problem at the time. His tenth problem asked if there is an algorithm that could decide whether any Diophantine equation had a solution. In other words, is every Diophantine equation decidable? Hilbert’s tenth problem has been solved, and the answer is no; such an algorithm does not exist. The solution was the result of 21 years of combined effort by Martin Davis, Yuri Matiyasevich, Hilary Putnam, and Julia Robinson. While no general algorithm exists for Hilbert’s tenth problem, the sum of cubes problem remains open. Solvable or not, the progress made on the sum of cubes problem thus far is impressive and serves as a reminder of how powerful the mathematics community is when it works together. It was a video produced in Berkeley, California that inspired a UK mathematician, an American mathematician, and a global grid of computers to find a solution for n = 42. With increasing links between mathematicians all around the world through the internet and the exponentially rising computing power we are capable of harnessing, the boundaries of what we can accomplish are constantly being expanded. Booker and Sutherland serve as proof that, when we harness innovation, we can truly solve the unsolvable. References: About. (n. d. ). Retrieved from https://www. numberphile. com/about. Booker, A.

    "title": "Q&A with Mr. John Ford: Being a Well-rounded Scientist",
    "body": " This year at Convocation, Mr. John Ford, a long-time Choate science teacher, received a faculty chair for his incredible dedication and passion for teaching. Recently, I had a chance to sit down with Mr. Ford to talk about his background in STEM and teaching, as well as some fun facts and advice for students. Q: What is your background in STEM?: A: I was a biology major in college, and I also did some graduate work in similar fields for my master’s degree. In my 45 years of teaching or so, I’ve taught all levels of biology as well as first-year physics and first-year chemistry. Q: What made you decide to pursue a career in STEM?: A: When I was in high school, I found that both my strength and interest was more in STEM areas — particularly, my interest was in biology. In high school, I never really took to the more verbal courses, English and history. I worked hard in them, but they just didn’t come as easily to me as STEM classes. And when I went off to college, I was pretty certain that I was going to major in biology — and I did. Sometimes people change their minds, but I didn’t. I did find some areas of biology that I didn’t know I would be interested in until I was exposed to them in college, which was good. I got to do a little bit of research with a couple of professors, and so I continued to pursue it. Q: What are your views on STEM education at Choate and beyond?: A: I worry a little bit about over-specialization. I think that sometimes high school students are too quick to specialize in an area and therefore dispense with other areas that they don’t realize they might have an interest. So I’m more of a fan of a general education, or what we consider a liberal arts education. I think that it’s really important, no matter what you’re doing, to be reasonably experienced in reading, writing, and scientific thinking, as well as quantitative skills. I don’t think any high school student should be avoiding any of that. Q: What are some important things you think Choate’s future scientists should know?: A: I think that what they should be careful of is getting too far down the road with something supposedly advanced in study without having a really good coverage of fundamentals. I worry sometimes when I see what students are doing in SRP in that they are looking at some pretty intricate and detailed studies related to their summer work in the lab, and that’s at the expense of covering the fundamentals. So what I think Choate science students should know is that it’s okay to take your time. Make sure that you don’t rush ahead into detailed, advanced work without covering core concepts first. Q: What are your proudest STEM or education accomplishments?: A: In my earlier days, my primary area of interest was in marine biology, and I think I did quite a few things to establish the study of marine science here at Choate. It’s been a long time since I’ve taught it here, but I laid a lot of groundwork for that. I did some pretty good and fun research myself, especially in coastal marine ecosystems and coral reef ecosystems. Q: What is your favorite book and/or character?A: I guess still my favorite book is The Catcher in the Rye and my favorite character is Holden Caulfield. It’s hard to pick one favorite, but I feel like Holden Caulfield has been with me for a long time. "

    "title": "Apple September Event: The New iPhone, Apple Arcade and More",
    "body": "2019/12/20 - Just like every year since 2017, 2019’s edition of the Apple September Event was held at the Steve Jobs Theater at 1 Apple Park Way, Apple’s headquarters. iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max: The most important release from this year’s September Event has to be the newest members of the iPhone family: iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. Equipped with what Apple touts as the toughest glass ever on a smartphone and milled from a single sheet of glass, the new iPhone is made to resist damage from drops and scratches. The iPhone 11, the successor to the much loved iPhone XR, will come in six new colors: purple, white, yellow, green, black and Product Red, while the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max will come in four colors: silver, gold, space gray and a brand new, sleek midnight green. Both phones are equipped with Apple’s new industry-leading processor, the 7nm A13 Bionic, which has not only 8. 5 billion transistors, but also the fastest CPU and GPU ever in a smartphone. The CPU, GPU and neural engine of the A13 are all optimized for machine learning. Thanks to new machine learning accelerators, the A13 can conduct a trillion operations per second. Moreover, both devices have IP68 water resistance ratings, meaning that the iPhone 11 is water resistant up to 2m underwater for 30 minutes while the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are water resistant up to 4m underwater for 30 minutes. However, the similarities between these two phones end here. The iPhone 11, like the XR before it has a 6. 1 inch LCD display, with a 1792 by 828 pixel resolution at 326 ppi (pixels per inch). On the other hand, the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max have 5. 8 and 6. 5 inch Organic LED displays respectively, with 2436 by 1125 and 2688 by 1242 pixel resolutions, both at 458 ppi, which is the same as the iPhone X, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. The new iPhone 11 has two 12MP (Mega Pixel) cameras, one wide and one ultra wide while the Pros have an additional telephoto camera that allows them to have 10 times optical zoom compared to the 11’s 5. Lastly, all phones are speculated to have 4GB of RAM (Random Access Memory) and are offered with 64, 256 and 512GB of storage. Available from September 20th, the iPhone 11 starts at $699 while the iPhone 11 Pro starts at $999 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1099. Apple Arcade: Although the release of the new iPhone models was definitely the highlight of the event, the keynote did not begin with them, but rather with the introduction of Apple Arcade, the newest additional to Apple’s burgeoning services branch. Available exclusively on the App Store, the game subscription service for mobiles, desktops and TVs gives unlimited access to over a hundred new games created by Apple in cooperation with various other innovative game developers. Apple Arcade will be available starting September 19th with a family subscription fee of $4. 99 a month, which includes 1 month free trial. Apple TV+: Apple TV+ is Apple’s new subscription based streaming service available for all Apple devices. Available from November 1st in over 100 countries, a family subscription fee will be $4. 99 a month. Even better, if you buy an iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV, one year of Apple TV+ will be included. iPadOS and 10. 2” iPad: The newest addition to the iPad is iPadOS, an operating system derived from iOS and designed specifically for the iPad. It will be available to all Choate students free of charge once permission is given from the IT Department. Apple claims the new iPadOS “adds new capabilities and intuitive features that are specific to the large display and versatility of iPad. ” Among them include new simplified multitasking and app sliding functions, a new smaller screen keyboard that can be accessed by pinching the preexisting keyboard, along with the ability to crop videos and SD card and thumb drive support among other functions. In addition, Apple released the 7th generation budget iPad, now equipped with a new 10. 2” retina display and powered by Apple’s A10 Fusion chip (the same chip that powered the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which were introduced back in 2016). Moreover, the smart connector and Apple Pencil support has finally arrived to the new iPad, which will be priced at $329, available September 30th. Last but certainly not least, the enclosure of the new 10. 2” iPad is made from 100% recycled aluminum. Apple Watch Series 5: Apple Watch has been the staple of practical smartwatches ever since its release back in April of 2015. From a design standpoint, Apple Watch Series 5 is virtually identical to its predecessor, the Series 4. However, the new watch has a retina always-on display, which dims instead of shutting off when it senses you are not looking at it. Despite having the screen on at all times, the new Apple Watch still maintains 18 hours battery life, the same as the previous Apple Watch thanks to energy optimization. Additionally, the new Apple Watch has a built in compass, which can be used in both the Compass app and Maps. Every cellular equipped Apple Watch Series 5 is equipped with international emergency calling, allowing you to call over 150 different emergency services from around the world. For the first time, the App Store will come to the Apple Watch via WatchOS 6, allowing developers to create Apple Watch orientated applications. Moreover, new useful apps for the Watch have been added such as the Noise app, which measures the decibel count of your surrounding area and alerts you if something is too loud, and the Cycle Tracking App which makes it easier to log information, keep track of your menstrual cycle and receive alerts when your period is likely to begin. Lastly, in addition to several new watch faces being announced, Apple revealed the Apple Watch Studio, a place where you can mix and match an Apple Watch to see what it is like before buying it. Apple proudly claims that there are nearly 1000 different ways to select your Apple Watch and are offering dozens of colors and textures of watch bands in addition to four different cases: ceramic, aluminium, stainless steel or titanium. While the contents of this year’s September Event certainly were not the most unexpected, it did include some welcomed additions to the Apple ecosystem.

    "body": "2019/12/10 - Nearly four years after the monumental observation of gravitational waves, scientists have detected tones in the “ringing” of a black hole for the first time, corroborating yet another one of Einstein’s theoretical predictions. According to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, a black hole formed from the collision of two other black holes produces “ringing” gravitational waves. However, what is special about the ringing of these gravitational waves is that they encode specific information about the nature of the black hole, namely their mass, spin, and electric charge. On September 14, 2015, scientists first detected gravitational waves using LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Gravitational waves are waves that transport energy in the form of gravitational radiation and propagate through a gravitational field, creating a ripple-like effect in space in the process. In order to study gravitational waves, scientists have translated the signals into sound waves, which crescendo over time. When black holes merge, the gravitational waves translate into a “chirping” sound. The chirp is loudest at the moment when the black holes fuse. The infant black hole that is created from the collision of the two parent black holes also produces gravitational waves that “ring;” however, physicists previously assumed that the noise created by the infant would be too faint to interpret amid the loud noise from the initial collision of the parents. Therefore, traces of this ringing have to be studied sometime after the peak, when the signal becomes too faint to be of much significance. The team that published the findings, led by Maximiliano Isi of MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, found a way to extract a black hole’s reverberation from instants after the signal’s peak. In previous work led by Isi’s co-author, Matthew Giesler of Caltech, the same team showed that the signal, particularly the portion immediately after the peak, contained “overtones,” which are loud, short-lived tones. “We detect an overall gravitational wave signal that’s made up of different frequencies, which fade away at different rates, like the different pitches that make up a sound,” Isi said for the MIT news. “Each frequency or tone corresponds to a vibrational frequency of the new black hole. ”When the team took the overtones into account, they were able to identify a ringing pattern specific to a newly-formed black hole. “This was a very surprising result. The conventional wisdom was that by the time the remnant black hole had settled down so that any tones could be detected, the overtones would have decayed away almost completely,” noted Saul Teukolsky, the Robinson Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics at Caltech and adviser to Giesler. Using these ringing patterns, physicists were able to use the equations Einstein outlined in his theory of general relativity to calculate the mass and spin of the black hole. These measurements concurred with previous measurements. If they had not matched, then the ringing patterns would have encoded more information than the mass, spin, and electrical charge of the black hole. However, the extra information would have violated Einstein’s No-Hair Theorem, stating that the only characteristics needed to define a black hole are mass, spin, and electrical charge, without any “excess hairs. ” The alignment of these measurements with Einstein’s theory is significant as it paves the way for more advanced work in ringing patterns in the future with better equipment. As LIGO improves its resolution techniques and more sensitive instruments are developed, scientists will be able to use the ideas put forth by Giesler and the Isi team to “hear” the ringing of other newborn black holes. “In the future, we’ll have better detectors on Earth and in space, and we will be able to see not just two, but tens of modes, and pin down their properties precisely,” Isi remarked. “If these are not black holes as Einstein predicts, if they are more exotic objects like wormholes or boson stars, they may not ring in the same way, and we’ll have a chance of seeing them. ” Clearly, the future of ringing patterns is abuzz with potential.

    "title": "Dr. Selena Gell: From Scientific Research to Teaching",
    "body": "2019/12/10 -  During her time at Choate, Dr. Gell has taught Honors Biology and Molecular and Cell Biology. Dr. Gell has an extremely strong research background with five years of work as a PhD student and five more as a postdoctoral researcher. This knowledge and experience allows her to teach a variety of classes and successfully train Choate students in true scientific research while leading the biology section of Choate’s Scientific Research Program. Dr. Gell was captivated by the scientific world from a young age. As a child, Dr. Gell was surrounded by family friends who were scientists and lead lives full of interesting people, ceaseless learning, and careers that improved the world through scientific advancement. On top of this, Dr. Gell possessed an innate interest in the natural world, often catching frogs and insects while spending most of her time outdoors. By the time she entered high school, she knew she wanted to become a scientist and eagerly took all of the science classes that were available to her. Beyond taking the normal sciences in high school, Dr. Gell also participated in an internship at an animal forensic laboratory. For college, Dr. Gell attended Brandeis University where she considered majoring in either chemistry or biology. Eventually, Dr. Gell’s interest in the work of some of her biology professors led her to choose biology and work in the Fulton Lab at Brandeis. While working in the lab, Dr. Gell studied a form of programmed cell death known as apoptosis, which has applications in developmental processes and cancer. This initial exposure to scientific research strengthened Dr. Gell’s goal to pursue a PhD in science. However, Dr. Gell knew that she wanted to take a break from her traditional education for a couple of years in order to participate in something new that benefited the world. After graduation, Dr. Gell worked with Teach for America for two years while teaching chemistry, biology, and physical science at a low-income high school in Phoenix, Arizona. Although this wasn’t the experience that initially revealed a passion for teaching within Dr. Gell, it most definitely helped shape the idea of incorporating more teaching in her future career. To combine her interests in both teaching and research, Dr. Gell decided to pursue a PhD at Brown with the goal of working at a small liberal arts college with a lab of her own in the future. For her PhD in molecular and cell biology, Dr. Gell studied selfish genetic elements using fruit flies in the Rob Reenan lab. Once finished with her formal education, Dr. Gell became a post-doctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical school. During her time at Harvard, Dr. Gell studied protein complexes involved in gene regulation, using the same yeast found in beer and bread. After five years of dedicated research work at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Gell stumbled across a job opportunity at Choate. Dr. Gell felt that the career opportunity offered by Choate would allow her to return to the teaching aspect she loved about science. One life lesson that Dr. Gell learned from her experience as a scientific researcher is persistence: “In science, most of the things you do fail. You try to experiment, it doesn’t work the first five times you do it, it doesn’t work the first ten times you do it. Every time you do it slightly differently, changing a variable until suddenly, one day, you actually get a result. ” She also notes the importance of time management as a key component to a successful life and career, “being in science taught me a lot about balance in my life and having to make time for things that are important to me outside of work. Being a researcher is the kind of job that can expand to fill all available time and I had to learn how to set aside time for me so that I came back to my work exited, refreshed, and ready to take on challenges. ” One of the things Dr. Gell set aside time for apart from her work life, was competitive rugby. In fact, Dr. Gell played competitive rugby for twelve years after starting in college at Brandeis. She also played for The Lady Blues while living in Arizona and Providence women’s rugby while at Brown, before retiring in 2012. Ultimately, competitive rugby provided Dr. Gell with an extremely useful outlet to refresh her mind from the demanding workload of college and laboratory research. With such an impressive background in both the academic and the athletic world, Dr. Gell serves as a perfect example of why being a Choate student is such an invaluable opportunity and experience. Faculty members like Dr. Gell allows us to not only receive an amazing education, but also learn important life lessons from their experiences. Together, this knowledge and wisdom are truly the reasons why so many Choate alumni have regarded their time here as priceless. "

    "title": "Your Package Has Been Delivered – By a Drone",
    "body": "2019/12/09 - As the demand for faster deliveries rises, many retail corporations in the US are working to implement new and innovative methods to transport their products to their customers. Adding automation and artificial intelligence are ways a company can not only manufacture and deliver the items faster but also reduce the cost of manual labor. Thus, many major retailers are moving towards implementing drone delivery services. The biggest e-commerce retailer in the world, Amazon, is about to implement all-electric autonomous drones into their delivery process. Announced at their inaugural re:Mars Conference in 2019, an event discussing the latest innovations in robotics and machine learning, Amazon’s recent delivery drones can fly up to fifteen miles and deliver packages to customers in less than thirty minutes. The drones use various sensors and algorithms to detect objects impeding their path and the surrounding environment. “We know customers will only feel comfortable receiving drone deliveries if they know the system is incredibly safe,” said Jeff Wilke, the CEO of Amazon’s worldwide consumer division. “So, we’re building a drone that isn’t just safe, but independently safe, using the latest artificial intelligence technologies. ” Amazon’s delivery drones also have a positive impact on the environment. Lowering carbon emission and the use of fossils, drones run totally on electric power and is a sustainable alternative to the conventional trucks used to carry their products. By 2030, Amazon plans to make half of all their deliveries carbon-free. In addition to Amazon, Walgreens and FedEx are also launching their own automated drone programs. Executing “final-mile deliveries, improving access to health care products, and creating possible new growth for local businesses” are the company’s objectives in this project. Partnering with Wing Aviation, a subsidiary of Google, Walgreens would possibly be the first US retailer to provide on-demand commercial drone delivery. By using drones, the company said it will make over-the-counter medicines, food, and other products available to nearby residents within minutes after their order. Walgreens already has 9,700 stores nationwide, and, therefore, would be able to capitalize on the drone delivery services. Walgreens is currently testing its drone delivery service in Christiansburg, VA because of Wing’s connections with the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership, a test site for unmanned aircraft. Final-mile delivery is the biggest component of the overall cost for companies and utilizing drones instead of people will lower their expenses. Despite the advantages drones give to companies, there are still some issues that need addressing. The biggest concern the public have involves the invasion of privacy. Many companies install cameras into their drones to make sure the product is successfully delivered and to avoid trees and other obstacles in the way. However, the camera may accidentally take a video of people and properties who aren’t associated with the transaction. Therefore, drone regulations needs to be updated in the future if they will be used as a staple mode of transporting goods for retail companies. However, despite these issues, drone delivery services are the next step in engineering and transportation. The efficiency and convenience of drone delivery will create a huge impact on people’s lives in the near future.

    "title": "Hydrogels: The Miracle Cure for Heart Attacks",
    "body": "2019/12/08 - Every 40 seconds, someone in the US experiences a heart attack, amounting to an average of 790,000 cases annually. A heart attack occurs when there is reduced blood flow to a section of the heart, resulting in damaged tissue or dead cells. One out of every five heart attacks is show no other symptoms, but damage is still done to the muscle. Following a heart attack, the heart muscles are weakened, resulting in thinner chamber walls and a frail heart. With cardiovascular disease on the rise—nearly half of adults in the U. S. are afflicted—researchers are coming up with a new treatment plan: using hydrogels to repair the heart following a heart attack. There is no current cure to repair the damage done after a heart attack as scar tissue forms around the heart and diminishes the efficacy of the muscles, leading to heart failure. Now, a company called Ventrix, based at the University of California, San Diego, has successfully conducted the first successful human trial of using an injectable hydrogel to repair the damage, stimulate muscle regeneration, and restore cardiac function. VentriGel, the hydrogel compound injected into the heart, works as a scaffold that facilitates a curative environment for healthy cells to repopulate. The hydrogel substance is made from cardiac connective tissue from pigs. It is then stripped of the heart muscle cells the human body would reject and run through an extensive cleansing process. Afterward, it is freeze-dried and converted to a powder form to be liquified into an injectable, semi-solid and porous fluid for the minimally invasive procedure. The main goal of the Phase 1 trial was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of VentriGel in 7 patients who suffered a heart attack within the past year and 8 who suffered a heart attack three or more years ago. Following the injection into the damaged regions of the heart and patient tracking for six months after the treatment, the Ventrix team reported that the hydrogel was effective and showed no adverse effects. In fact, VentriGel nearly restored the damaged heart chamber walls to their original condition before the heart attack. The trial completed its goal to measure the effects of the hydrogel and whether it improves cardiac function of the patients and helps them walk longer distances enabled by improved heart health. Following the success of Phase 1, Ventrix is preparing for the Phase 2 clinical trial consisting of a larger, randomized trial. While this FDA-approved Phase 1 clinical trial is monumental progress, there is still much work to be done in this field of research. In the coming years, hydrogel treatment may be able to terminate deaths due to heart failure following a heart attack. References: Hydrogel to repair heart proves safe to inject in humans.

    "title": "Q&A with Mr. John Ford: Being a Well-rounded Scientist",
    "body": "2019/12/06 -  This year at Convocation, Mr. John Ford, a long-time Choate science teacher, received a faculty chair for his incredible dedication and passion for teaching. Recently, I had a chance to sit down with Mr. Ford to talk about his background in STEM and teaching, as well as some fun facts and advice for students. Q: What is your background in STEM?: A: I was a biology major in college, and I also did some graduate work in similar fields for my master’s degree. In my 45 years of teaching or so, I’ve taught all levels of biology as well as first-year physics and first-year chemistry. Q: What made you decide to pursue a career in STEM?: A: When I was in high school, I found that both my strength and interest was more in STEM areas — particularly, my interest was in biology. In high school, I never really took to the more verbal courses, English and history. I worked hard in them, but they just didn’t come as easily to me as STEM classes. And when I went off to college, I was pretty certain that I was going to major in biology — and I did. Sometimes people change their minds, but I didn’t. I did find some areas of biology that I didn’t know I would be interested in until I was exposed to them in college, which was good. I got to do a little bit of research with a couple of professors, and so I continued to pursue it. Q: What are your views on STEM education at Choate and beyond?: A: I worry a little bit about over-specialization. I think that sometimes high school students are too quick to specialize in an area and therefore dispense with other areas that they don’t realize they might have an interest. So I’m more of a fan of a general education, or what we consider a liberal arts education. I think that it’s really important, no matter what you’re doing, to be reasonably experienced in reading, writing, and scientific thinking, as well as quantitative skills. I don’t think any high school student should be avoiding any of that. Q: What are some important things you think Choate’s future scientists should know?: A: I think that what they should be careful of is getting too far down the road with something supposedly advanced in study without having a really good coverage of fundamentals. I worry sometimes when I see what students are doing in SRP in that they are looking at some pretty intricate and detailed studies related to their summer work in the lab, and that’s at the expense of covering the fundamentals. So what I think Choate science students should know is that it’s okay to take your time. Make sure that you don’t rush ahead into detailed, advanced work without covering core concepts first. Q: What are your proudest STEM or education accomplishments?: A: In my earlier days, my primary area of interest was in marine biology, and I think I did quite a few things to establish the study of marine science here at Choate. It’s been a long time since I’ve taught it here, but I laid a lot of groundwork for that. I did some pretty good and fun research myself, especially in coastal marine ecosystems and coral reef ecosystems. Q: What is your favorite book and/or character?A: I guess still my favorite book is The Catcher in the Rye and my favorite character is Holden Caulfield. It’s hard to pick one favorite, but I feel like Holden Caulfield has been with me for a long time. "

    "title": "Warmer Climate, Denser Ice",
    "body": "2019/12/05 - With youth-led strikes all over the world demanding change and the UN 25th International Climate Conference coming up in Chile, climate change is becoming an increasingly relevant issue today. New studies come out every year on the topic; one bleak discovery after another appearing on various news outlets. The newest information: the Greenland ice sheet is getting denser. When a heat wave struck Greenland this year, over half of the Greenlandic ice sheet—the second largest after the Antarctic ice sheet—started melting at an unprecedented pace for the first time since 2012. A study published by Nature stated that along with the sudden increase in melting ice, amplified by the warming climate, the ice sheet is becoming denser as well. Many people believe Greenland is a thick wall of impenetrable ice. In reality, about 80 percent of the ice is fresh snow layered on top of thicker, older snow, called firn, which in turn is compressed into glacial ice over time. As firn contains many air pockets, liquid water melting from the surface normally gets trapped inside. Through a complex “plumbing” system, firn then absorbs the water like a sponge. Data from a radio-echo sound (a kind of ultrasound machine for ice) showed in 2014 that some ice is stored within the crevices of the system until the arrival of winter, when they are either released back into the system or refrozen. The summer of 2012, a group of researchers noticed that the Greenlandic ice was behaving differently. They found fully compact, solid slabs of ice right beneath the freshly fallen snow. The lack of air pockets prevented runoff water from entering the ice sheet; instead, they transferred straight into the ocean. Every summer of increased melting leads to a thicker and harder slab of ice spreading inland to higher and colder grounds. Due to global warming, the ice is melting at an unprecedented pace. Now, glaciers are losing one billion tons of ice per day, and the runoff has expanded by 26 percent. Researchers estimate that ice slab proliferation has the potential to add three inches to sea levels by 2100, a third of all the current contributions to sea level rise. In addition, glaciologists pointed out that the slabs of ice are not nearly as reflective as firn. The ice absorbs more solar radiation than firn and warms up, resulting in the formation of even more slabs, a vicious cycle that sets off a slew of environmental issues. Some runoff might not even flow into the ocean. They might end up at the very bottom of the sheet, assisting as a slippery slide and lubricating the area where ice comes in contact, leading to the sheet flowing towards the ocean with more ease than ever. The greatest contribution of this study, however, is a deeper understanding of Greenlandic ice patterns. With this information, scientists are now able to predict with higher accuracy the predictions of future sea level rise in order to assist threatened coastal communities. Scientists also gained an increased awareness that the more carbon the world is emitting into the atmosphere, the more likely the Earth’s northern ice sheet would be unpredictably transformed in an insidious manner.

    "title": "Discovery of Superelastic Properties in Mammalian Epithelial Cells",
    "body": "2019/02/04 - In October 2018, Nature published a study titled “Active superelasticity in three-dimensional epithelia of controlled shape”1 which provided evidence for the appearance of cell superelasticity in mammalian epithelial cells upon undergoing extreme tension. Superelasticity, a property usually found in metallic alloys, is characterized by a cell’s ability to completely reverse large-scale deformations and elongate itself without increased force23. During this state, cells develop liquid-like properties and no longer become resistant to tension. In this study, mammalian epithelial cells were chosen because of their known ability to resist tension as well as their ability to pump water from their upper side to their lower side2. The water would then form a dome under the cells which would create tension and cause the cells to elongate (Figure 1a). During this process, some of the cells became superelastic, stretching to a wider cell surface than the elastic cells (Figure 1b). Adhesion junctions, the connecting area between cells, are the weakest points of pressure and eventually rupture from the increasing force. As a result, the water is able to escape from the dome which releases the tension from the cells (Figure 1c). Since none of the cells were in a state of plasticity, where irreversible damage can be done to the cellular shape3, all the cells return to their original, compacted position with superelastic cells appearing the same as other cells (Figure 1d). Previously, scientists believed cells under identical tension would have the same degree of shape deformation, but this experiment also shows that different cells have different thresholds for superelasticity. As shown in Figure 1, not all of the epithelial cells become superelastic at the same time, which researchers theorized was a result of the varied cellular mechanical properties (such as sensitivity to tension) of each cell2. Additionally, only under specific conditions can a cell enter a state of superelasticity. Cells that are placed under rapidly increasing pressure, even for a short duration, usually rupture while cells with slowly increasing pressure are able to maintain the dome structure for over hours2. Although this study has provided insight into a topic on which there was very limited understanding, there are still many questions left regarding cellular superelasticity. For one, there is still no definite reason as to why this occurs. Latorre et al. examined the connection between a cell’s cortex thickness and its superelastic threshold but there wasn’t substantial evidence supporting this hypothesis. The cell cortex is composed mainly of actin filaments, cytoskeletal filaments that maintain cellular structure and shape by relaying forces both within and between cells4. They hoped to show that cellular stretching resulted in the breaking apart of these filaments which would lead to a superelastic state, but the results didn’t show a direct correlation2. But, they were able to show the involvement of intermediate filaments, filaments that only provide mechanical strength to cells and are not involved in cellular movement1. When intermediate filaments in superelastic cells underwent laser ablation (essentially removing them), cell surface increased, which showed that they had resisted tension and were load-bearing (a theory that was suggested due to their unusually stiff structure in super-stretched cells)1. From this, they theorized that the weakness of the cortex induces support from the intermediate filaments and helps the cell elongate. The discovery of cellular elasticity has important implications on researching other cellular processes, such as the spreading and compaction of super-stretched embryonic tissue1 and can also lead to developments in cellular mechanics and engineering. By further examining cellular properties, mechanics, and processes like morphogenesis, we may reach a better understanding of what cellular elasticity is and how it impacts our world.

    "title": "Stanford Researchers Identify Human Bone Stem Cells",
    "body": "2018/11/30 - In a study published on September 20, 2018, a team of researchers at the Stanford University of Medicine identified a multipotent human skeletal stem cell that gives rise to new bone or cartilage in the body. The implications of this study can lead to new regenerative treatments for fractures, arthritis, and bone injuries. Stem cells are cells that have not yet been differentiated and can self-renew for extremely long periods of time to keep their colonies intact. Once differentiated, stem cells become specialized cells required for regenerative therapy. These cells then differentiate into specialized cells called progenitor cells, which make up human tissues. The adult stem cell is lineage-restricted, meaning that it can give rise only to certain types of tissue like bone, cartilage, and stroma. The cell can also be isolated from human bone and even be generated from specialized cells in fat. They can also arise from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), a hot-topic technology in current stem cell research. The stem cell is found in increased quantities at the end of a developing bone or the site of a healing fracture. These stem cells are different from mesenchymal stem cells, which have had limited success in various clinical trials. Mesenchymal stem cells are isolated from the blood, bone marrow, and fat, and are considered to be all-purpose stem cells. However, these stem cells are very loosely characterized and may actually comprise of a large variety of cell populations, which may account for why they respond differently and unpredictably to differentiation signals. “In contrast, the skeletal stem cell we’ve identified possesses all of the hallmark qualities of true, multipotential, self-renewing, tissue-specific stem cells. They are restricted in terms of their fate potential to just skeletal tissues, which is likely to make them much more clinically useful,” said Charles K. F. Chan, PhD, assistant professor of surgery at Stanford. This study is a large advancement for stem cell research partly because it does not include ethical complications that are otherwise attached to the field of stem cell research. Pluripotent stem cells are usually derived from embryonic stem cells, which come from human embryos and exist only at early developmental stages. This stem cell, in contrast, bides its time in adult tissue until it differentiates. “There are 75 million Americans with arthritis, for example. Imagine if we could turn readily available fat cells from liposuction into stem cells that could be injected into their joints to make new cartilage, or if we could stimulate the formation of new bone to repair fractures in older people,” said Michael Longaker, MD, professor of plastic and reconstructive surgery at Stanford. Another implication of the study is that it provides a technological advantage convenient for researchers working with human hematopoietic stem cells–that is, the stem cells in human bone marrow that give rise to the blood and immune system. These skeletal stem cells don’t require growth factors in the serum used as the environment containing hematopoietic stem cells. Instead, they provide an environment where hematopoietic stem cells can thrive. The stromal population that arises from the skeletal cell can keep hematopoietic stem cells alive for two weeks without the need for additional serum. Researchers of the study also constructed a family tree of stem cells, which could be used in clinical applications and provide a way to understand the similarities and differences between mouse and human skeletal stem cells. This, in turn, may lead to discovery of key evolutionary differences between humans and mice. The researchers had used the mouse skeletal stem cell to locate and isolate the human skeletal stem cell by comparing gene expression profiles of the mouse skeletal stem cell with those of cell populations at the end of bones. “I would hope that, within the next decade or so, this cell source will be a game-changer in the field of arthroscopic and regenerative medicine,” Longaker noted. “If we can use this stem cell for relatively noninvasive therapies, it could be a dream come true. ” "

    "title": "Ferrofluids: The Magnetic Liquid Dancer",
    "body": "2018/10/30 - The 1900s brought about countless exciting inventions from all across the globe. Sometimes a little mysterious, many of these inventions were intriguing and versatile. One such invention was the ferrofluid, a substance that serves a variety of purposes in fields ranging from rocket science to school science fairs. Ferrofluids are commonly recognized as spiky liquids that “dance” under the influence of magnetic fields. Technically defined, ferrofluids are stable colloidal suspensions of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. The magnetic property of ferrofluids derives from these tiny iron oxide particles. Because of these nanoparticles, ferrofluids do not stay magnetized after being removed from the presence of a magnetic field. Patented in 1965 by NASA chemist Steven Papell at the Lewis Research Center, ferrofluids were initially developed by scientists intending to facilitate the transfer of rocket fuel into a spacecraft’s engine. In space, the lack of gravity allows fuel to float within the holding tank and makes it difficult for the fuel to be efficiently pumped into the engine. Papell envisioned transforming the non-magnetic fuel into one that could be controlled and guided by the maneuvering of magnetic fields. Although Steven Papell’s idea was never practiced (as NASA preferred the use of solid rocket fuel to the concept of liquid magnetic fuel), it did incite the fervor to research this new magnetic substance. In fact, there was so much excitement surrounding ferrofluids that the mechanics of magnetic fluids was recognized as a new branch of science known as Ferrohydrodynamics. Even after the rapid development of solid rocket propulsion technology eliminated the need for magnetic fuel, ferrofluids did not leave the realm of rocket science. Only a few years after their invention, ferrofluids were reconsidered for use in rockets, but this time to manage the spacecraft’s temperature: the temperature of the side of the rocket facing the sun is significantly higher than that of the side in shadow, which can introduce problems to the spacecraft. 	More recently, it was also found that ferrofluids could improve speakers. In loudspeakers, electric energy is sent through a coil near the center of a circular permanent magnet. The current running through the coil induces a magnetic field, causing the coil to vibrate and produce an amplified sound. By coating the coil in a ferrofluid, engineers are able to dampen unwanted resonances and dispel excess heat from the coil. As a result, the speaker is able to have better sound quality. 	Nowadays, ferrofluids are being developed and tested for potential use in the biomedical field. Medical researchers are hopeful that with magnetic fields, medicine can be transferred quickly and easily through the human body. Ferrofluids are also being used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques as contrast agents. 	In this fast-paced new era when inventions and innovations are constantly springing up from every corner, ferrofluids are no exception. Engineers and scientists in every field are coming up with more enhanced and creative ways to employ ferrofluids within their work. One could also say that ferrofluids are practically spiking up with unbridled potential! References: A Brief History of Ferrofluid. (2014, December 23).

    "title": "Brain-on-a-Chip: Another One of the Organ-on-a-Chip Inventions",
    "body": "2018/10/27 - Bioengineering has rapidly evolved in the past decade, with novel technologies constantly introduced to study challenging subjects. A product of this era of rapid technological evolution, the “brain-on-a-chip” device was created in 2018 by scientists of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in an attempt to determine the effects of chemicals, biological agents, disease, and pharmaceutical drugs on the brain. This device overrides any need for human or animal subjects, making its fabrication particularly significant for future neuroscience research. The complex neuronal plasticity and diverse cellular interaction of the human brain have previously obstructed the creation of an efficient brain-on-a-chip device, making LLNL’s research all the more impressive in its field. The device is essentially a wafer of semiconductors connected to a network of nanowires. To stimulate the central nervous system, the chip records neural activity from multiple brain cell types deposited and grown onto microelectrode arrays. The nanowires create functional neuronal circuits that represent the interconnectivity of neurons. The platform is a result of the lab’s in-vitro Chip-Based Human Investigation Platform project, or iCHIP. It is expected to increase understanding of how brain cells interact and combat disorders and to determine how exposure to chemical and biological weapons impacts the human mind. The chip is divided into four sections — three sub-regions and an external region representing the brain’s cortex — to best imitate the areas of the brain. Researchers then positioned primary hippocampal and cortical cells onto the electrodes corresponding to their orientation in the brain. To execute this feat, the scientists used custom-fabricated inserts that were removed after the cell placement to allow free interaction and communication within the regions. The electrical energy emitted by cells during communication, known as action potential patterns, were monitored over time. With this device, scientists hope to better understand the networks formed among various regions of the brain using only human-relevant data and without any animal testing. The device’s resultant data is meant to provide a more applicable model of how certain types of neurons react to chemical exposure and predict human response to countermeasures. Stated iCHIP co-lead author and LLNL research engineer Dave Soscia, “While we’re not close to the point where we can fully recapitulate a brain outside of the body, this is an important step in terms of increasing complexity of these devices and moving in the right direction. The idea is that eventually the community gets to a point where people are confident enough in the devices that the effects they see from putting chemicals or pharmaceutical drugs into the platform environment are similar to the results we would see in the human body. ” The technology also reveals how cells communicate in diverging ways when combined with or in close proximity to different cell types. Because the microscale, funnel-shaped insert does not require patterning its surface with different chemicals for cell adherence, it allows for the insert to be utilized on a variety of chip-platforms and cell types. “Here you literally just put an insert in, pipette the cells through the top of the insert, and it deposits them with precision onto specific regions on the electrode array. And because it’s removable, the cells adhere but they have nothing holding them back; they’re allowed to grow freely and communicate with the other regions,” added Soscia. “It was very important to us that we didn’t have physical barriers, so the cells could grow processes to interact and communicate. ” The “brain-on-a-chip” phenomenon began with researchers at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in 2017 creating a device that indicated the communication differences between neurons coming from different parts of the brain. LLNL’s work represents the most recent application of the technology in studying the impact of long-term exposure to biological and chemical agents. In the future, LLNL will continue chip-based research as part of a strategic initiative focused on the brain under principal investigator Nick Fischer. Researchers aim to incorporate brain and blood-brain barrier chip platforms and eventually expand the ‘brain on a chip device’ to three-dimensions. To fully analyze and model the novel device’s data, the researchers hope to connect with computer-scientists and statisticians—and truly understand their extraordinary results.

    "title": "Pinpointing Possible Treatments for Spinal Cord Injuries",
    "body": "2018/10/24 - The spinal cord is one of the most important parts of the body—it is essentially a bundle of nerves that runs down the back and carries signals back and forth between different parts of the body and brain. Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) disrupt these signals by damaging the spinal cord. The two kinds of spinal cord injuries—complete and incomplete—are categorized by the degree of damage done onto the spinal cord. Complete injury means the body is completely paralyzed below the injury, while an incomplete one entails some retainment of movement control and sensation below the injury. Prone to severe paralysis, SCIs are medical emergencies. With immediate medical treatment, long-term effects can be reduced. However, a wholly effective treatment does not exist at the moment, particularly regarding immediate restoration of motor and sensory function after the injury. This is due to a lack of understanding of the complex biological processes behind a spinal cord injury. To better understand this complex process, Skinnider and his research team integrated data from decades of smaller studies. They found that M3 group genes were most strongly linked to the severity of injury in both mice and rats. In fact, annexin A1, a gene in the M3 group, could perfectly differentiate between moderately and severely injured rats. Jordan Squair, a lead author of the study, concluded, “We have identified gene signatures that predict injury severity and, if reversed therapeutically, could potentially increase functional recovery. ” Another reason for the lack of fully effective treatment for SCIs is the absence of information regarding nerve regeneration in humans. Nerve regeneration is the ability of animals like frogs, dogs, whales, and snails to regrow nerves after an injury. Humans and primates, however, do not possess this ability. However, in an older study conducted at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies, it was found that the protein p45 promotes nerve regeneration by preventing the axon sheath from inhibiting regrowth. The problem is that humans, primates, and other advanced vertebrates lack this p45 protein; instead, they have the protein p75, which binds to the myelin when there is nerve damage. A newer study at the Salk Institute found that growth-promoting p45 could disrupt p75 pairing, which latches onto inhibitors released from the damaged myelin. Axons were able to grow with fewer p75 pairs available to bind to inhibitors. These findings implicate important therapeutic advancements. Introducing p45 protein to injured neurons or a small molecule that could jam the link between the p75 proteins could serve as a potential therapy to spinal cord damage. The next step will be to see if introducing p45 helps regenerate damaged human nerves. References: Mayo Clinic Staff. (n. d. ). Spinal cord injury.

    "title": "Puzzle in the Primes: Atiyah’s Attempt at the Riemann Hypothesis",
    "body": "2018/10/24 - Mathematics is constantly evolving under the eager minds of a vigorous and thriving research community. At the cornerstone of mathematics, particularly in number theory, are the prime numbers–natural numbers divisible only by one and themselves. Recently, the mathematics community discovered a pattern in such numbers, attempting at a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis. One of the most famous unsolved mathematical problems in history, the hypothesis seeks to prove a special property of the Riemann function that can approximate the distribution of primes, given by a relationship between two functions: the prime-counting function π(x) and the Riemann zeta function. In 1859, mathematician Bernhard Riemann, presented a paper titled “On the Number of Prime Numbers Less Than a Given Quantity. ” At the heart of the paper was an explicit formula for the number of primes up to any predetermined limit, an improvement on the approximation of π(x). For this formula to hold true, the values at which the Riemann zeta function equals 0 must be known. The Riemann zeta function is defined as the analytic continuation of the series (s)=1+12s+13s+14s…, or (s)=n=11ns, for complex-valued s, which converges when the real part of s is greater than 1. Since the series does not converge and is thus undefined when the real part of s is less than 1, the zeta function is “constructed” through a process called analytic continuation on the entire complex plane. This process extends the series from its defined values so that all of its higher derivatives exist, are continuous, and hence “analytic. ” For all negative even integers (-2, -4, -6, etc. ), (s)=0 ; these values are called trivial zeros. The primary focus of the Riemann Hypothesis deals with the infinite number of non-trivial zeros and claims the following: all non-trivial zeros have a real part equal to 12 (i. e. all non-trivial zeros can be expressed in the form 12+yi, where i =-1. )While values of s within a magnitude of 1013 have computationally been tested to agree with the assertion of the Riemann zeta function, the Riemann Hypothesis has yet to be proven in its general form. For years, many attempted to prove or disprove the assertion, but none has succeeded. This past month, at the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF), Sir Michael Atiyah presented his attempt at proving the original Riemann Hypothesis. In his 45-minute lecture, he described how a seemingly unrelated concept in physics–the fine structure constant, which describes the strength and nature of electromagnetic interactions between charged particles–was the key to proving the Riemann Hypothesis. The two concepts are supposedly related by the Todd Function, introduced in Atiyah’s paper “The Fine Structure Constant. ” There, Atiyah introduced certain properties of the Todd function including analyticity on all compact sets of the complex plane. However interesting this connection seems, though, the claim was met by much skepticism from the mathematical community. To his critics, Atiyah responded, “Nobody believes any proof of the Riemann Hypothesis, let alone by someone who’s 90,” remaining adamant about the veracity of his proof. Still, the verdict seems unlikely to come out in his favor. A large part of his theoretical work lies in his proof to the Proceedings of the Royal Society A that has yet to be published. As of the writing of this article, no definitive response to Atiyah’s proof has been published, but the general consensus appears to be that his proof is, at the very least, flawed. While this “proof” may not be the ultimate solution to the Riemann Hypothesis, Atiyah’s shortcomings still provide the opportunity of an open problem for the mathematical community. For the next generation of mathematicians, this problem may entail advances in the discovery of the distribution of the primes and better cryptography techniques. With advances in mathematical machineries, we may see a solid proof of the hypothesis in the next few decades. References: Heidelberg Laureate Forum.

    "title": "Exciting Developments in Bendable Phone Technology",
    "body": "2018/10/24 - An iPhone bent around your wrist to become an Apple Watch. A touch screen car display curved across the entire dashboard. An iPad rolled up and slid into your pocket. Thanks to new bendable electronics technology invented by scientists at the Australian National University and experimental designs created by smartphone companies, these futuristic gadgets may not be that far away. On October 5th, scientists from the ANU Research School of Engineering reported that they invented a thin, flexible semiconductor that could retain the efficiency of light conversion to electricity. Associate Professor Lu stated, “For the first time, we have developed an ultra-thin electronics component with excellent semiconducting properties that is an organic-inorganic hybrid structure and thin and flexible enough for future technologies, such as bendable mobile phones and display screens. ”The semiconductor’s small width can be attributed to its hybrid structure: a one-atom-thick organic component paired with a two-atom-thick inorganic component. This hybrid structure enables the semiconductor to emit precise light beams to produce high quality images. According to PhD student Ankur Sharma, “The light emission from our semiconducting structure is very sharp, so it can be used for high-resolution displays and, since the materials are ultra-thin, they have the flexibility to be made into bendable screens and mobile phones in the near future. ”The scientists also reported that the semiconductor is much faster than conventional smartphone semiconductors made only of inorganic materials like silicon. According to Mr. Sharma, there is “potential with this semiconductor to make mobile phones as powerful as today’s supercomputers. ” Moreover, because of the organic component, the new semiconductor is now biodegradable and recyclable. The technology’s environmental benefits make the invention highly desirable in a world where the amount of global e-waste is projected to reach 49. 8 million tons this year. This new invention arrives as major smartphone companies – including Apple, Samsung, and LG – have begun filing patents for designs and prototypes of bendable phones. These designs capitalize on the flexibility of OLED displays, the most common type of display used as the screen for every major flagship phone. These displays emit their own light, meaning they do not require a backlight to illuminate them so that they may be fastened to flexible plastics. However, smartphone screens are not flexible in spite of their OLED screens because these screens are trapped inside robust metal cases. The main issue with creating a bendable phone is that not only the screen has to be flexible but also the other components of the phone. Phone batteries, in particular, are extremely difficult to bend. Among the prototypes for flexible phones, Samsung has created one of the more notable designs. Samsung’s patent describes a 7. 3-inch OLED display encased inside a metal frame with a hinge. The diagrams included in the patent show the phone opening and closing like a notebook. When the screen reaches the completely open and closed states, a locking and unlocking mechanism solidifies the screen to prevent the phone from collapsing in the user’s hand. At the launch of the Samsung Galaxy A9, CEO Dong Jin Koh announced that the device will be able to be unfolded to a fully-functioning tablet with multitasking capabilities and then folded back to a portable phone. Due to the flexibility of the screen, the phone is also reported to be virtually unbreakable. In July of this year, the phone was certified by Underwriters Laboratories to be able to survive several rigorous drop tests and temperature tests based on military standards set by the US Department of Defense without any damage or impact on functionality. However, the most exciting news from Samsung is that these new designs will be used to build the screen for the Samsung Galaxy X, the next flagship phone for the company set to be released next year. According to Mr. Koh, “When we deliver a foldable phone, it has to be really meaningful to our customer… If the user experience is not up to my standard, I don’t want to deliver those kind of products. ”In addition to Samsung, LG has also filed a patent for the design of foldable phone. However, LG’s phone, unlike the Samsung Galaxy X, folds vertically instead of horizontally. The patent focuses on the phone’s hinge mechanism, which extends the device’s outer side as the phone folds to reduce stress and pressure on the screen. Each edge of the phone also contains magnets that keep the phone closed when folded, as well as a microphone, speaker, and antenna. This suggests that users could use the phone from both orientations. The camera, on the other hand, is placed near the center of the device, next to the hinge. This camera placement corresponds to another diagram in the patent paperwork that shows a user with the phone folded over his front shirt pocket like a pocket protector and the camera centered on the front-facing side of the phone. LG likely intended the phone to be clamped onto the front pocket for hands-free video recording. Bendable electronics are expected to be the future of the smartphone industry and the consumer electronics industry. Phone companies like Samsung and LG are already creating innovative and futuristic designs, while research laboratories in institutes like the Australian National Universities invent new and improved bendable technologies. Hopefully, these new bendable electronics will be able to live up to their full potential in the near future. References: ANU College of Engineering &amp; Computer Science. (2018, October 04).

    "title": "Why Algorithmic Thinking is Important in Computer Science Education",
    "body": "2018/10/24 - Python is used as an introductory language for computer science classes in many schools. With its easily understandable syntax and compatibility with almost any computing environment, Python is the perfect language for new programmers. Other languages like C or C++ are not suitable for introductory courses as they vary across platforms, which makes it hard for instructors to teach a large class without hiccups. Even Donald Knuth, a renowned computer scientist, remarked, “C++ is too complicated. At the moment, it’s impossible for me to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless I avoid all exotic features. ” He further commented that “to think of programming in C++” “would make him physically ill. ” However, for those who decide that an introductory computer science course is sufficient for what they plan to do in life, learning how to use Python through project-based work should not be the focus of their education. There’s a simple reason for this: programming languages change over time, so there is a high chance that code written 10 years ago would no longer run on a new version of the same programming language. Because of this, using class time to teach the syntax or advanced features of any language is not a productive use of time in an introductory course. Instead, the reason for using Python as a primary language should be that it’s the optimal language for algorithmic thinking. Teaching algorithmic thinking allows students to practice logical thinking. To understand what algorithmic thinking is, one must first define what an algorithm is. According to the Oxford Dictionary, an algorithm is “a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations. ” Learning why those sets of rules are in place is the core of algorithmic thinking, for students would be able to create and apply their own algorithms without having to rely on code they found online. As a result, students would be less reliant on other sources of help, such as the Internet. Outside of programming, algorithmic thinking has many applications. Divide and conquer, an algorithmic technique with applications ranging from sorting to proving mathematical claims, can be used to accomplish tasks in an organized and methodical manner. Using the task of “getting into your dream college” as an example, one could divide it up into smaller subproblems, like “getting better grades” and “starting a club. ” Each one of these subproblems could then further be divided into more specific goals. These “mini-goals,” which are achievable within an immediate frame of time, include “doing homework during study hours” or “hanging out with Bob after the test, not before. ” Another algorithmic technique, dynamic programming also has real-life applications outside computer science and mathematics. A well-known dynamic programming problem is: If there are P items in a bucket and each of them has a price Q and size R, which items should one take to fit in a bag of size S such that they maximize the value of items in the bag? Contrary to intuition, progressively taking the items with the highest value would not yield maximum profits. This is because taking several smaller items with a smaller value can lead to a higher net value than taking one very large but costly item. The same concept can be applied to real life. The ‘greediest’ option might not be the best option. For example, continuously taking the shortest paths to get from point A to point B would clearly not yield the shortest path. With a focus on algorithmic thinking, students would not only be more autonomous within the realm of computer science but also use this acquired skill set outside of class even for ideas that are simply intuitive. In this way, algorithms improve not only computers but hopefully also our daily lives. "

    "title": "Honey Bees: Prime Models For Memory Storage and Alzheimer’s",
    "body": "2017/12/25 - In an effort to further understand the long-term development of memory and memory impairment diseases, researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia recently used honeybees to uncover the impact of DNA methylation. By examining the presence and significance of DNA methylation, the study found that this particular epigenetic process does in fact affect the way a honeybee’s brain remembers and relearns. The study, conducted by Dr. Stephanie Biergans, depicted that certain molecular mechanisms that regulate memory specification and relearning could have a significant impact on the ways experiences are integrated into long-term memory. Biergans states, “There is thought to be a genetic predisposition for some conditions, such as Alzheimer’s and dementia, but in many cases environmental factors determine whether the disease will manifest. ” The researchers aim to use honeybees in order to discover more about molecular and environmental changes that lead to memory impairment diseases. Although honeybees may appear to be a questionable parallel to Alzheimer’s patients, they are valid models for helping researchers discover more behind the disease’s cause. “Honeybees have an amazing capacity to learn and remember,” says Biergans. “They can count up to four, and orientate themselves by learning patterns and landmarks. They are also social insects that interact, teach, and learn, making them successful foragers. Bees remember how to find a food source, how good the source was, and how to return to the hive. ” Because they can form complex memories like humans but have a simple brain structure, honeybees have become a prime model for researching the formulation of long term memories. Researchers in the past have established that Alzheimer’s disease and memory formation are partly controlled by molecular changes in the brain’s chemistry. As the DNA makeup is altered, physical changes may occur, including differing or new neutral activity and connections. Epigenetic mechanisms, which are a series of molecular changes that can occur due to experience or environmental changes, are known to affect memory formation in humans. They regulate gene expression through DNA modification without changing the individual gene. The Australian research team wanted to determine if DNA methylation, an epigenetic process, had an impact on how honeybees learn and relearn data. Based on what is needed, methylation can make a certain gene stay active or inactive. Biergans added, “We knew that DNA methylation is an epigenetic process that occurs in the brain and is related to memory formation. When we block this process in honeybees, it affects how they remember. ” The experiment involved two separate groups of honeybees, both of which were taught to expect sugar in the presence of a particular scent. The first group learned over an extended period of time; however, the second group was only exposed to the scent once. As explained by the research team, they taught the bees, “to associate an odor with a sugar reward, similar to the olfactory learning taking place when a bee collects nectar from a flower during foraging. ” Then they blocked DNA methylation in a few bees in each group using an inhibitor compound. After evaluating both groups with and without DNA methylation, the scientists changed the smell and repeated the process in order to find stable and ongoing conclusions. The University of Queensland’s researchers ultimately found that DNA methylation plays a significant role in defining how a bee can relearn. “When the bees were presented with sugar and a smell many times together, the presence of DNA methylation increased memory specificity they were less responsive to a novel odor,” summarizes Biergans. “On the other hand, when only introduced to the combination once, DNA methylation decreased specificity. ” The results reflect how a honeybee gets and chooses its source of nourishment; when a flower continuously proves to be a proficient source of food, the bees will search for that specific smell. Bees that were not able to methylate were not able to form memories that were as strong or specified as the bees that did methylate. Through this process, the scientists have discovered information that may allow them to provide treatments for brain diseases in the future. The simple mind of a honeybee has proven to be an accurate and helpful model in understanding the processes behind long-term memory formation. Linking the physical changes in neural connections to human brains could uncover the mystery behind conditions like dementia and Alzheimer’s. Future research is expected to build of of Biergans’ study. Researchers are hopeful to expand the scientists’ findings. Biergans states, “By understanding how changes to the epigenome accumulate, manifest, and influence brain function, we may, in the future, be able to develop treatments for brain diseases that also develop over a lifetime. ” "

    "title": "Making Meteor Showers Sing",
    "body": "2016/05/16 - meteor-sky. jpg For centuries skywatchers have reported hearing a sound as a meteor visibly passed overhead. Professional astronomers, however, consistently dismissed the possibility of a meteor being seen and heard simultaneously based on the physics of sound and light. Particles from asteroids or comets that enter the Earth’s atmosphere is traveling at very high speeds and the friction generated by moving against air particles heats these meteors. Consequently, most meteors vaporize and create the sought after shooting star streaking across the sky. Yet sound travels much more slowly than light does. Disintegrating meteors visible to an observer on Earth’s surface are typically 60 miles above the planet’s surface. Thus a meteor would not possibly be heard until approximately five minutes after having been sighted. Given this reasoning, when a fireball passed over England in 1719, astronomer Edmond Halley (who calculated the orbit of the eponymous Halley’s Comet) concluded that reports of “hearing it hiss as it went along, as if it had been near at hand” had to be “the effect of pure fantasy”. Yet the phenomenon continued and reports from meteor listeners accumulated. Astronomers now understand that observers reporting hissing, sizzling or buzzing sounds during meteor showers are not delusional but rather are likely experiencing electrophonic sounds. In addition to releasing electromagnetic radiation in the visible portion of the spectrum, meteors release very low frequency (VLF) radio waves, which travel at the speed of light. Humans cannot directly hear these radio waves which oscillate at audio frequencies between a few kilohertz and 30 kilohertz. But in the presence of a physical object acting as a transducer, VLF radiation is converted into sound waves that a human ear can detect. Colin Keay, a physicist at the University of Newcastle in Australia during the 1970s, showed in a laboratory study that radio waves can induce low-frequency currents and rustling sounds in ordinary objects, even wire-framed eye glasses. He hypothesized that when the magnetic fields in the glowing trail of a meteor are permeated by Earth’s magnetic field a potential source of energy for VLF waves is created. Researchers tested Keay’s hypothesis and found that distinct VLF electromagnetic pulses were produced during the Leonid meteor shower of November 1999. Recently Dave Prochnow described how a person could hack an old stereo receiver in order to cause an audible spike in signal reception when a meteor passes overhead. In this case, the hacker is using the radio and a good FM antenna to pick up the signal of a distant FM radio station whose strength has been augmented when reflected by the ionized trail of a meteor. Although mechanistically very different from Keay’s documentation of electrophonics, this hack attempts to achieve the similar phenomenon of “hearing” meteors. In fact, radio engineers regularly monitor for “meteor echoes” by detecting TV signals that are reflected from meteor trails and “radio meteors” by detecting radio signals that bounce off the ionized gases produced by disintegrating meteoroids. In both cases, listeners can hear a brief “ping” on the receiver’s speaker when a meteor passes by with the correct geometry. In addition to detecting the many meteors that are too dim for the human eye to see, radio observing is advantageous because meteors can be detected 24 hours a day and even when skies are cloudy. The International Meteor Organization and the North American Meteor Network list dozens of meteor showers that are monitored almost exclusively by radio observations and not detected by their visual counterparts. Often these are “daylight meteor showers”. Radio observation, however, provides no information to the listener regarding where the meteor came from. Experienced visual observers can discriminate the direction or constellation from which a meteor emanates but radio detection cannot. Prochnow’s published instructions appear in the November 2014 issue of Popular Science under the title of “Listen in on a Meteor Shower: How to Repurpose Your Old Radio to Listen to Meteor Showers”. In addition to a stereo receiver and an FM Yagi antenna, the hacker needs to have downloaded Radio-SkyPipe II software on a computer. Making meteors sing seems to be a good candidate for a collaborative project between Astronomy Club and STEM Club. Let’s hope it’s coming soon to a Science Center roof near you. "
