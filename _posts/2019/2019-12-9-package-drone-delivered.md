As the demand for faster deliveries rises, many retail corporations in the US are working to implement new and innovative methods to transport their products to their customers. Adding automation and artificial intelligence are ways a company can not only manufacture and deliver the items faster but also reduce the cost of manual labor. Thus, many major retailers are moving towards implementing drone delivery services.


The biggest e-commerce retailer in the world, Amazon, is about to implement all-electric autonomous drones into their delivery process. Announced at their inaugural re:Mars Conference in 2019, an event discussing the latest innovations in robotics and machine learning, Amazon's recent delivery drones can fly up to fifteen miles and deliver packages to customers in less than thirty minutes. The drones use various sensors and algorithms to detect objects impeding their path and the surrounding environment. "We know customers will only feel comfortable receiving drone deliveries if they know the system is incredibly safe," said Jeff Wilke, the CEO of Amazon's worldwide consumer division. "So, we're building a drone that isn't just safe, but independently safe, using the latest artificial intelligence technologies." Amazon's delivery drones also have a positive impact on the environment. Lowering carbon emission and the use of fossils, drones run totally on electric power and is a sustainable alternative to the conventional trucks used to carry their products. By 2030, Amazon plans to make half of all their deliveries carbon-free.


In addition to Amazon, Walgreens and FedEx are also launching their own automated drone programs. Executing "final-mile deliveries, improving access to health care products, and creating possible new growth for local businesses" are the company’s objectives in this project. Partnering with Wing Aviation, a subsidiary of Google, Walgreens would possibly be the first US retailer to provide on-demand commercial drone delivery. By using drones, the company said it will make over-the-counter medicines, food, and other products available to nearby residents within minutes after their order. Walgreens already has 9,700 stores nationwide, and, therefore, would be able to capitalize on the drone delivery services. Walgreens is currently testing its drone delivery service in Christiansburg, VA because of Wing's connections with the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership, a test site for unmanned aircraft. Final-mile delivery is the biggest component of the overall cost for companies and utilizing drones instead of people will lower their expenses.


Despite the advantages drones give to companies, there are still some issues that need addressing. The biggest concern the public have involves the invasion of privacy. Many companies install cameras into their drones to make sure the product is successfully delivered and to avoid trees and other obstacles in the way. However, the camera may accidentally take a video of people and properties who aren't associated with the transaction. Therefore, drone regulations needs to be updated in the future if they will be used as a staple mode of transporting goods for retail companies. However, despite these issues, drone delivery services are the next step in engineering and transportation. The efficiency and convenience of drone delivery will create a huge impact on people's lives in the near future.
