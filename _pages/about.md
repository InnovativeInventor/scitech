<h5>Science</h5>
Science helps humans understand the past, present, and future. SciTECH reports on current developments and their applications in any area of science including the fields of physics, chemistry, and biology. Through informative articles, we highlight and explore current research and innovations, their uses in society, and the future possibilities. Writing about science provides an opportunity for a writer to further his or her scientific knowledge through extensive research while also educating readers on news discussed throughout the world.

<h5>Technology</h5>
Today, technology is the largest growing field where innovators are always trying to make the next discovery. SciTECH seeks to inform readers of the latest innovations that are transforming society and research. The articles describe and analyze technological ideas and the impact on society and/or research. We focus on the components and function of technology as well as changes in the technology sector. Writers inform themselves of the latest technology and understand the need for innovation.

<h5>Engineering</h5>  
Since the dawn of time, engineers have created pivotal technologies that have transformed the worlds of communications, healthcare, information technology, energy, business, and beyond. We aim to inform readers on recent developments in the field of engineering, as well as its relation to society and social adjustment. The articles explain how engineers have connected ideas in novel ways, integrated technological innovations into everyday life, and applied their discoveries to make the world a better place. With these objectives in mind, we hope to provide readers with a deeper understanding of the role of engineering in today’s world.

<h5>Culture</h5>
Science cannot be without critical intersections. No advancement in science, technology or engineering is without its own, sometimes profound, sometimes subtle, ramifications for society. The converse is also true for major political, economic, and civil events. Science, technology, and engineering do not operate in a vacuum, and are shaped by the world at large. In SciTECH, we explore these intersections. We seek to inform readers about the impact, by chance or by design, that the fields covered in other sections of SciTECH have on society and on readers’ lives. We also seek to inform readers of the means by which they can, in their personal and political decisions, consciously and inadvertently, affect the direction of science, technology, and engineering.

<h5>Hacks</h5>
In SciTECH, students can also showcase their newest projects and provide insight for readers embarking on a similar project. We include descriptions of fun STEM projects made by members of the Choate community and beyond, and tutorials for projects that readers can follow.
